This slugcat could be your hunting buddy! You go to grab a spear off the ground, 
but as soon as your hand touches it, the slugcat finally reacts to your presence. 
They unload their arsenal on you, raining down spears at lightning speed. 
You can't dodge them all, and quickly succumb to your injuries.
