"Hello. Was that guy bothering you?"
A green colored slugcat floats down from the sky in front of you.
It has an aura of tranquility around it, yet some part of your mind
feels some instinctive primal fear from its very being.
The slugcat has an extremely long tongue, quite a bit different
from any other slugcat you've encountered before. 
In any case, this is the first of your species you've encountered here and could be an eligible mate.
