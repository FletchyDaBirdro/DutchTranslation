You descend beneath the ground, to the deepest reaches where the nature of reality distorts, the
fog demons roam, and past civilizations border the void. Surely for someone with your experiences,
this would be the most appropriate location to potentially find a mate to spend your life with.
However, it is not always so.
Once the search begins, one does not always find what they are looking for.

Explore the void.
