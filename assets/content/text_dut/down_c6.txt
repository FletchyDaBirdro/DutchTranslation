The slugcat settles the egg on the ground and stares at it with determination.
"Let me take care of this. It'll all be over soon."
They enter into a deep concentration, and begin to levitate slightly above the ground.
A bright X-shaped light forms above their head, and then begins to travel towards the egg.
As the light settles over the egg, it begins to grow increasingly brighter.
Then in a quick culmination, the light is met with a deafening pang as it ruptures the egg.

Cover your ears.
