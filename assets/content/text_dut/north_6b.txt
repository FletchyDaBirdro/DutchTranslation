"i kinda get wat it feels like to be nerfed, tbh..." 
You pat spearmaster on the shoulder.
"i gotta eat soo much food to hibernate, its just dumb. they even removed me from arena mode, wth??!"
"Yeah, I guess you have it rough as well. These developers hate us." 
Spearmaster looks at you with deep understanding.
"Honestly I heard a rumor they were going to remove me from the game entirely. Absolutely sadistic."

Give spearmaster a hug.
