You accept this reasoning.
No need to force the issue further, you can find another mate elsewhere.
You wave goodbye to the slugcat, and it takes flight off to who knows where.
However, you're also very close the void sea.
Perhaps you should just take the dive and procrastinate on worrying
about relationships until after you've stripped your mortal coil.

Head to the void sea.
