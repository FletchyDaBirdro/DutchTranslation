"STOP HURTING MY MOM!!" 
The other slugcat skips across the surface of the water pool
at a speed that should not be physically possible.
Before you know it their hands are around your throat.
They push you down under the water and hold you there.
You struggle to get free, but there's no hope.
The glow of the floating food items twinkle above the surface of the water, looking like stars.
It's a beautiful final vision to end your journey on.
