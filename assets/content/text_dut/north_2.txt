You approach the strange slugcat cautiously, watching it as it climbs to the top of the tower. 
You're not sure what it is doing, but you hope that it is another slugcat. 
Maybe you could have a conversation or whatever slugcats do.
You call out to it, but it doesn't react. Perhaps it is deaf, or cannot hear you. 
You begin to wave your hands in an effort to get its attention.

Throw a rock at it.
