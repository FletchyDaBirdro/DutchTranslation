Suddenly in the distance you see a crimson colored slugcat. 
She is aggressive and seems to have the ability to create explosions 
from her body, and propel herself with the shockwaves. 
She is a mother slugcat, who is grieving the loss of her children.
Regardless, she is your only hope of continuing your lineage.
You must choose to approach her carefully, or else she'll flee due to 
her being terrified and grief-stricken.

Sneak up on her.
