The hefty slugcat stares at you, chins wobbling. "You're a pro... gamer?"
You nod. The hefty slugcat stares at you, seemingly in thought. 
"A pro gamer, huh? I've never heard that one before. I've heard plenty of others, but that's a new one."
"its true tho." The hefty slugcat stares at you and puts a finger to their chin. 
"I'm afraid a liar is all that I see before me. Liars have been known to make the most insane of claims."
Your heart rate increases. You've never been great under pressure.
"lmao, a liar?! nah, check this, they call this a pro gamer move"
You throw your egg by your feet, and prepare to use a gravity manipulation 
strat to fling yourself super far with the singularity.

Perform your frame perfect input.
