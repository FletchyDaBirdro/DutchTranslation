You travel to the west, towards a very overgrown section of the world.
The world was once filled with many amazing things, and vegetation was one of them. 
By traveling to the west, you are searching towards a place that has grown wild with plants and flowers. 
As you make your way up a hill, you see a large hefty slugcat, who seems 
to have no problem maintaining their diet in this challenging world. 
As you watch, you notice that they seem to have the ability to generate 
infinite objects by regurgitating them from their stomach.
You approach carefully, unsure of whether to attack or to speak to them.

Pick up a spear and throw it at them.
