You stick the marshmallow in your mouth, and it is immediately not what you were expecting.
While it is soft and chewy like a good slime mold would be, it has an added layer of awful spice.
It's actually so gross. Your entire mouth is on fire.
As you swallow, you feel as if acid is running through your insides.
You fall to the ground in pain. What did you just eat?!
The world around you goes blurry as the fire rages inside.
This will be your final meal.
