It's bright... extremely bright. But only for a moment.
With all its might, Spearmaster's spear sucks the singularity into it, absorbing it as a nutrient.
The distortion of space subsides, but spearmaster's spear
and attached umbilical begin to glow with a blinding light.
"What... is this? I can't absorb it all...!!"

Reach your hand out to rescue Spearmaster.
