"Alright!" they say. "I'll make a feast."
"whatever u want, my luv."
You both sit on some logs around the bonfire, watching it burn.
You watch as they begin to cook more food than you've ever seen.
"are u sure u can eat all that?" you ask.
They begin laughing, and nod their head.
"I'm a really, really big slugcat. I need a lot of food."
You stare at them in amazement. 
You've never seen a creature that large move around in such a rapid manner before.

Start eating the food as it's prepared.
