You continue moving cautiously, approaching the mother slugcat at a slow pace. 
It isn't working; she remains frightened of you. 
You try to think of how to calm her, but it seems your efforts are in vain.
She grabs the spear lying on the ground next to her. You watch as she aims it directly at you.

It pierces straight through you, and you fall to the ground.
You have been killed by the mother slugcat.
