The beast stares at you and begins to move towards you slowly.
It opens its jaws and shrieks, a sound unlike anything you have ever heard before.
You are awestruck by its appearance, and that feeling is only amplified by
the divine presence you feel as its vocals resonate through your chest.
It slams its large black talons upon you, pinning your body to the floor.

You blush profusely.
