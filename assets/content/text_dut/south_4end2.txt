You pick up a rock and hand it to the mother slugcat. 
She holds it in her hand and stares at it, but doesn't seem to be pleased.
She places it into her mouth, coating it with an explosive substance. 
She spits it out, having turned the rock into an explosive. 
She holds it in her paws and seems to admire it, and then throws it at you. 
It explodes upon impact with you, causing you to fall backwards. 
You are dazed and confused as the world spins around you.
You struggle to breathe as the world fades to black.
