The hefty slugcat looks behind you. 
You follow their gaze and see that the three red lizards and the giant red centipede have surrounded you.
"Go ahead and fight them. I'm a peace loving slugcat, fighting isn't really my thing," the hefty slugcat says.
You sigh, and turn to face the enemies behind you.
The three lizards hiss and growl, flashing their teeth.
Before you get a chance to do anything, you're covered by their spit, while they quickly maul you to death.
