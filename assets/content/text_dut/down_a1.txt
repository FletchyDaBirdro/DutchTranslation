You reply to the slugcat in your best courting tone,
hoping to impress upon it the seriousness of the situation you are in.
However you have no reaction from the slugcat.
Instead you receive a feeling of trepidation from it, as if it knows something you don't.
This causes you to have second thoughts about making a move.
