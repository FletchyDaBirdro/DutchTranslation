The slugcat gives you a strange look, but then complies.
Their tongue launches at you slapping you across the cheek.
As it retracts, the stickiness of it pulls you forwards causing you to faceplant onto the floor.
That was less romantic than you thought it would be.
Actually quite insulting.

Lay there in embarassment.
