"I'm sorry," the hefty slugcat says.
The heavy slugcat suddenly slides towards you at an incredibly alarming speed.

You don't get to finish your sentence before the hefty slugcat slams into your midsection.

The hefty slugcat presses down on top of you, and you wince as 
the heavy slugcat's immense weight crushes your frail body.
