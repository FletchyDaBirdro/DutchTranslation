You trek to the north, towards a land of towering structures that pierce the heavens. 
You traverse the rocky, hilly fields, as you avoid the large predators that roam this area. 
It is here where you hope to find a mate, if they even exist in this strange place...
You spot a strange slugcat climbing one of the towers, unlike any you've seen before. 
It has no mouth with which to eat or speak with, and is able to generate spiky bone-like protrusions from its tail. 
It does not react when it notices you, giving you a good view of it. Fascinating.
Do you approach it, to see if it is your compatible either as a mate or a food resource?

No.
