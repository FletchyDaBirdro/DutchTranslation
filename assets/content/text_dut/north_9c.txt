Spearmaster struggles for a moment, before their body collapses in on itself.
Into a single point of matter smaller than your eye can even perceive.
But with it, all other surrounding matter begins to be absorbed into the
point as well, in a runaway cascading collapse. You try to run, but you
begin to be absorbed into the point almost as fast as you can try to react.
Before you know it, your body is spaghettified, and your surroundings go black.
Yet, somehow, you are still conscious.

Observe your surroundings.
