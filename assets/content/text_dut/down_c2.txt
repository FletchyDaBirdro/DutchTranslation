You lay faceplanted on the floor feeling kind of dumb.
You roll over onto your side expecting to see them laughing at you.
Instead you see the slugcat casually floating over to take your egg.
"woah woah, wat do u think ur doing there??!"
They ignore you and continue towards the egg.

"hey dont touch that!!"
