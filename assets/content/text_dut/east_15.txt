Suddenly your stomach starts to rumble.
"Okay, forget all of that, you poor thing, you must be starving!"
Your partner's mother orbits around you with concern.
"I can't believe my child didn't feed you before coming here, they have no manners!"
You try to track her position as the robotic arm spirals around frantically.
"They're trying to date you and yet don't even know how to take care of you, for shame!~"
"nah its cool im used to starving..." you shrug.

"do u have any food tho?"
