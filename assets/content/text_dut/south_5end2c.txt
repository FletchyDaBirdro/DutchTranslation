You pull the large, round pearl from your stomach, and offer it to her.
Immediately a hundred scavengers emerge at the sight of the pearl, with raised spears. 
You back away, and the mother slugcat hisses and spits at them. 
The scavengers growl in anger, and begin charging at you both. 
The two of you are outnumbered, but you have each other, and that's all you need. 
You both stand ready to fight. You and the mother slugcat fight valiantly 
against the vicious horde of scavengers, but you are ultimately overcome. 
You sacrifice yourself, taking several of the scavengers with you. 
She escapes without so much as a scratch, leaving you to die a warrior's death.
