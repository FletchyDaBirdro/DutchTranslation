You remain silent and hidden among the tall blades of grass, slowly approaching the mother slugcat. 
Your body is shaking nervously and your eye is twitching. 
Your efforts of remaining unseen are in vain; the mother slugcat looks directly at you.
You feel your heart pounding as she stares into your eyes. She lets out a loud hiss, 
jumping backwards in an exaggerated fashion. She is scared of you, just as you are of her.
It seems you share a tragic bond; both of you are lonely individuals.

Keep moving towards her.
