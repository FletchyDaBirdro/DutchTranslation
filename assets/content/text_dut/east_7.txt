You still do not know what to make of this slugcat.
Its body is blue and slimy and you do not feel particularly well about it.
You would prefer to have a less hyperactive friend.
You notice that it's watching you very carefully, as if it is waiting for a chance to pounce on you.
You cannot help but feel that it is a little too friendly and you are not quite sure why.
Perhaps it is just the effect of the creature's natural exuberance and you are over-thinking it.

Break the silence.
