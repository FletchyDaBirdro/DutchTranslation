This slugcat doesn't know what it's talking about.
What higher priority could there possibly be than you?
Being your mate is the only priority that matters, you just need to make the slugcat realize their mistake.
"well, im not leavin here without a mate, and ur not leaving here without one either!"
You stand your ground. However, the ground doesn't help you much, as the
other slugcat simply takes flight into the air and swiftly leaves.

Make chase.
