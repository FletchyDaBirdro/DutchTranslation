Honesty is the best policy. You tell the machine that you are here to find your soulmate.
Your partner's mother looks at you with new eyes.
"You creatures and your romantic ideals. How sweet. A soulmate is someone who will
help you find your path in life, be it good or bad. Am I right so far?"
"yea i think so."
"I'm glad you were brought here to find someone special, someone who will love and cherish you forever.
It's important to find someone to share your life with,
to find someone who will accept you for who you are, and will love you unconditionally."
"yooo, lol, that is exactly wat i was gonna say!!"

Smile at the kind machine lady
