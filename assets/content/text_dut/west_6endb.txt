You list the many dangerous things you encountered on your journey to find a mate.
"I don't know what any of that stuff means..."
The hefty slugcat seems even more confused.
"nvm," you say. "ill just find the colony, lol."
You begin to walk away, but the hefty slugcat stops you.
"I can't let you do that. You're an intruder."
"i need to see it! wat if my fated mate is there?? i cant let this go."
The hefty slugcat stares at you with apathy.
"Look, I get that you have needs, and I sympathize. But if you go to our colony, we're gonna have issues."

Maneuver your way past.
