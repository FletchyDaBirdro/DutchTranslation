A creature suddenly springs out at an alarming speed.
It's another slugcat like you, except blue colored with some kind of strange aquatic gills on their face.
They jump up and down in excitement upon seeing you.
"It's another slugcat! It's another slugcat!" It says, clearly an energetic one.
It continues speaking excitedly.
"Hwah! Another slugcat! Did you come here to scavenge materials too?!"

"im scavenging for love <3"
