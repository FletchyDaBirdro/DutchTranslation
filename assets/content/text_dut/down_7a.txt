The creature grabs you by the neck, lifting you off the ground by your fleshy appendages.
You see a long, sharpened, canine tooth on the upper jaw protrude as the beast opens its mouth to bite you.

The way it stands and holds itself suggests an immense amount of strength and stability.

You blush profusely.
