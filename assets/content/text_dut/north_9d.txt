Within the expanse of blackness, you soon see an unfamiliar silhouette.
Mechanical noises whizz as it slowly pivots its way towards your location.
"Little creature. You are my first visitor, but hopefully not the last.
I expected I would be visited by one of my own, but I suppose a dimwitted creature like you will suffice."

"this is pretty unlore, my man."
