Before you get a chance to react, red balls of spit fly through the
air and begin pelting the vultures. They fly backwards, looking shocked.
"You vultures think you rule this canopy? Not when I'm around.
I'll rip your wings right off your body."
The red lizard makes quick chase, and the three vultures decide to make an escape.

Threaten the red lizard with your spear.
