She softly smiles, and gives you a kiss on the cheek. 
You take her paw in your hand, and look into her eyes. 
Behind her, the sun bursts through the clouds, 
casting an array of beautiful colors on the landscape. 
The rain stops falling, and a rainbow forms overhead.

Regurgitate a pearl from in your stomach.
