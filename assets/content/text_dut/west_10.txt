As the egg cooks, reality itself seems to begin to bend around the resultant food product.
Time seems to warp, and you watch as steam rises as if in slow motion.
It's as if the salt, pepper, and heat of the fire all bend 
space and time to reach a primordial state of deliciousness.
You stare at the hefty slugcat with bewilderment, but your mouth can't help but salivate.
With a sudden primal hunger, the other slugcat greedily consumes all of the egg.
Their body begins to glow and levitate, and infinite matter begins to radiate from their mouth.

You shield your eyes.
