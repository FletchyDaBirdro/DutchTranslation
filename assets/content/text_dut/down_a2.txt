You question the slugcat's response to you. You're just not feeling the vibes, and want to make sure
you're on the same wavelengths with your potential mate. You try to reassure the slugcat.
"yo, something must be wrong wit my eyes, cause i cant take them off u~"
"Are you trying to imply something?" the slugcat asks, looking a bit annoyed.
"uh yea, u picking up what im throwin down?"
"Yeah, you're making fun of my eyes?"
"wat... no?!"

Throw down another one.
