You pull out your trusty egg that you carry with you all the time. 
Spearmaster looks it over curiously. 
"It has a hard shell, so I'm not sure how effective my spears would
be at siphoning from it... but I suppose it's worth a shot."
You place the egg on the ground and line it up neatly for a clean throw from
one of spearmaster's spears. They take aim and throw a direct hit into the egg. 
It immediately distorts the space around it like a miniature black hole.

Shield your eyes.
