You try to wrap your arms around the hefty slugcat's large exterior, but your arms cannot reach all the way around.
The hefty slugcat laughs and says, "You're cute."
You're not sure how to respond, so you laugh nervously. 
The hefty slugcat is just standing there, laughing.
"uh... ur really warm," you say, trying to think of something to say.
"Yeah, I suppose I am," the hefty slugcat says, and begins laughing again.
Neither of you know what to say, so you sit in silence for a while.
