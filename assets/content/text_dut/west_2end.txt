The spear flies through the air in an arc and lands in front of the hefty slugcat. 
They look at it, and then they look at you. You back up slowly, unsure of what they will do. 
They pick up the spear, sniff it, and then throw it at you. You try to duck, but get hit in the leg.
"Ohh! I'm sorry!! I thought you would catch it!" the heavy slugcat says, running towards you.
"what??"
"The spear. I threw it so you would catch it. I didn't mean to hit you."
You stare at them in disbelief.

Hold your leg in pain.
