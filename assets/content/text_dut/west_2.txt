You pick up a small rock and throw it at the hefty slugcat, but it bounces off their fat exterior, completely unfazed.
The hefty slugcat stares at you, narrowing their eyes.
You widen your eyes and begin to sweat profusely, preparing for the hefty slugcat's retaliation.
The hefty slugcat walks towards you, raises a tiny stubby arm, and pokes you in the forehead.
"I wasn't expecting to see someone else out here. You're not from my colony, right?" they ask.
"uh... no? im looking for another slugcat to be my mate, owo" you say.
"Ah, so that's it. I can tell by the way you said it, it's not an easy thing for you to say. 
Things have been tough lately, haven't they?"

"tough? nah im a pro gamer."
