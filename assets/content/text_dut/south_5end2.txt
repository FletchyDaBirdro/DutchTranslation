You let out the words; the truth that you couldn't hold back. 
The mother slugcat turns her head, and begins walking 
towards you with a curious expression on her face. 
She rubs your head with her paw, and you can feel your heart pounding in your chest. 
She hugs you with one of her claws, and you hug back.
