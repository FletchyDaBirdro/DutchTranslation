"g-golden lizard... aah... from echo..." 
You attempt to formulate a proper sentence, but find that you are too terrified to even speak.
The beast does something that causes your mouth to gape open and your eyes to widen in terror.
The creature steps forward and looks down on you with malice in its eyes.
You feel a tremendous pressure as the creature's horrible visage is applied to yours.
You are powerless.

You blush profusely.
