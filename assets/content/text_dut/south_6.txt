You take out the egg you've been carrying around, and give it to her. 
She accepts it, and her eyes brighten up. 
With a smile on her face and the egg in her hands, she sits down.
She places it in her mouth and coats it with a transformative bacteria. 
She spits it back out and places it on the ground. 
The egg begins to glow in a bright light.
She steps back and stares at it, and the egg begins to transform. 
Figures emerge from the light.
